      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <u>
        <li>
          <strong>Oil:</strong>You'll need about a quart of vegetable oil for
          frying the funnel cakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Milk</strong> Milk lends moisture, ensuring a perfectly tender
          funnel cake.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eggs</strong>Two eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they act
          as a binder for the batter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flour</strong> All-purpose flour creates structure in the
          funnel cake batter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener,
          which means it helps the batter rise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cinnamon and </strong><strong>salt</strong>Ground cinnamon and
          a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the funnel cakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sugar</strong> Sprinkle the funnel cakes with powdered sugar
          (a.k.a. confectioners' sugar) right before serving.
        </li>
      </u>
      <h3>Step</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) in a heavy skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use your finger to cover the funnel hole; pour in 1 cup of batter. Starting in the center of the skillet, remove your finger and move the funnel in a swirling motion to make a 6- or 7-inch round. Fry in hot oil until bottom is golden brown; flip and continue cooking until golden brown all over, about 1 minute per side. Drain on paper towels. Continue cooking remaining batter.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.</li>
